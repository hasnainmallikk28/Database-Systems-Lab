🗃️ Lab 05: Database Normalization (2NF & 3NF)
MySQL Normalization

📖 Overview
This repository covers advanced database normalization, progressing from First Normal Form (1NF) through to Third Normal Form (3NF). It features the systematic decomposition of two datasets: finalizing the Online Bookstore scenario and solving the complete Hospital Management System assessment from scratch.

🧠 Concepts Applied
Second Normal Form (2NF): Eliminated partial dependencies from composite keys, ensuring non-prime attributes rely on the entire primary key.
Third Normal Form (3NF): Extracted transitive dependencies into distinct tables, strictly separating independent entities (like Customers, Doctors, and Departments) from transaction records (like Orders and Visits).
Anomaly Resolution: Verified through SQL JOIN reconstruction that data redundancy is minimized and structural anomalies are completely eliminated.
📁 Files Included
2024-SE-37-Lab05-2NF-3NF.sql: A fully independent SQL script containing the 2NF and 3NF conversions for the Bookstore, alongside the complete, end-to-end solution for the graded Hospital Assessment Problem.

🚀 How to Run
Execute the script in your preferred MySQL environment. It operates completely independently—establishing its own databases (bookstore_norm and hospital_norm), decomposing the tables into 3NF, populating the data, and running the final verification queries automatically.
